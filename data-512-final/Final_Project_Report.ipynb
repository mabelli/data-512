    "> For my final project, I decided to focus on the effects of coronavirus (covid-19) on people's working environment, specificially the status quo of remote working. The impact of covid-19 on people's working environment is a phenomenon I observed and experienced my own. Nearly all companies in the US switch to remote conferences and remote work, with many of them planning to shift some of their employees to remote working permanently. Personally, I did my virtual summer internship at home and had mixed feelings about it. On the one hand, I enjoyed the convenience of no commuting and the flexibility of working hours and location. On the other hand, I felt like I lacked enough interactions and connections with my coworkers, cannot fully express myself when having meetings, and lacked motivations and efficiency due to a non-changing work-life environment. Comparable to working from home, all students have been studying from home since Marach. In conversation with my classmates, I learned that they have similar feelings of increasing convenience with lack of interaction and motivation. Working or studying from home has generated career-wise, social, mental, and physical impacts on the labor force and this change will persist after the pandemic, making it fundamental. <br>\n",
    "The long-term impacts of remote working on people's well-being are under debate and it is not clear whether it generates more positive or negative effects. Before the prospects are clear, I want to understand how different groups of people differ in their remote working status and affected by this working status. I hope the results of this project can help us understand of the impact of covid-19 on existing employment status of different population groups. "

    "> Remote working and the study of it have been around for a while. Formally, remote working means working outside of traditional organizations' definition of space and time. Before pandemic, a major group of remote workers work in tech-related industries in which the work can be performed remotely with computer and communication support. A study in 1983 examined behavioral, organizational, and social issues surrounding remote work. The study suggested that the important features of remote work jobs are minimum physical requirements, individual control over work pace, defined deliverables, and a relatively low need for communication. Individuals who succeeded in worked at home were highly self-motivated and self-disciplined and have skills which provided them with bargaining power. In addition, they made the arrangement either because of family requirements or because they preferred few social contacts beyond family. \n",
    "The study points out the pros and cons of remote work and suggests that remote work is not for anyone. Remote work gives individuals control over the working pace and environment and provides flexiblity for family requirements. However, remote work reduces social connections and is not suitable for everyone. For remote work to be successful, the organization needs to provides an environment for telecommunicating and the individual needs to thrive with minimum supervision. <br>\n",
    "More articles and blogs have summarized the pros and cons of remote working. Pros include increased productivity, flexible schedule and location, less distraction, and saving time and money. Cons include reduced visibility, less collaboration, social isolation, and distractions from home. <br>\n",
    "Another study conducted the research from the corporation perspective and found that working remotely has provided great benefits to businesses and let them significantly increase plans for remote hiring in the future. Overall, it seems like the impacts of working remotely vary for businesses and individuals. The goal of my study is to analyze the current remote working trend and anticipate its effect. "

The link to their github repo including the paper and the collected data is [here](https://github.com/johnjosephhorton/remote_work). In the survey, researchers asked a single question: \"Have you started to work from home in the last 4 weeks?\" and provided people with the following 6 response options: \n",
    "1. \"I continue to commute to work\"\n",
    "2. \"Used to commute, now work from home\"\n",
    "3. \"Not working for pay before start of COVID19\"\n",

There are missing values for the gender, age, and geography columns, which are labelled as 'unknown' and I removed them when conducting the analysis. \n"

    "#### Method 1:  Analysis of variance\n",
    "> Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is a method for analyzing the differences of group means in a sample. Each group is treated as a factor level. The hypothesis is that there is no difference between group means. If p-value is less than 0.05, the hypothesis is rejected, indicating that there is a significant difference between group means. Since I am comparing different groups for their remote working conversion rate, using ANOVA to compare the conversion rate is an effective method for this analysis. For my project, I have two factor levels (groups) for gender variable, 7 factor levels for age, 4 factor levels for region, and 51 factor levels for state. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Method 2: Tukey's pairwise comparison\n",
    "> Tukey's pairwise comparison is used with ANOVA to create confidence intervals for all pairwise differences between factor level means. This method would tell us which groups are different from each other and which are not. Since I want to know for variables that has a significant difference between group means, which specific factor levels have different means, this method is informative.\n",

    "1. The data was collected from June to July, so the results reflect the situation during that period rather than the  lastest situation. \n",
    "2. The people who participated in the GCS might not be representative of the genenel population. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Implications\n",
    "> There are several implications for this study. First, I found out that while ANOVA test for gender itself is not significant, there is an interaction effect between age and gender. It implies that for different age groups, people of different gender would make different decisions of whether or not to convert to remote working. I find the results of senior people pretty interesting, which indicates that they remained communting the same as younger people and are less likely to switch to remote work. Considering the health risks senior people are exposed to, this result can be surprising. Second, I found out that people from different regions or states make decisions differently for remote work. It is likely affected by the number of covid cases in each region. "

    "> From this project, I was able to further my understanding of people's remote working status. I found out that the remote working decisions are different regionally, state-wise, and for gender and age. People's remote working decisions have largely been shaped by health and safety issues, which are different reasons compared to those who chosen to work remotely before pandemic. It is likely that some people, while not suitable or desire remote work, would work remotely after the pandemic. Remote working will shift the dynamic between employee and employer further, with the former reported more profits and the latter's prospective uncertain. I hope that in the future, the impacts of remote work will be clearer and people can take strategies if it is improving equality between different population groups or worsening the gap. "
