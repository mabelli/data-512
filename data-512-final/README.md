# DATA 512: Human Centered Data Science - A4: Final Project Preliminary Proposal

## Author: Mabel Li

The goal of this repository is to carry out human-centered quantitative analysis for the final project of this course. 
My research focuses on the effects of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on people's decisions to work remotely. I used the data collected in the [survey](https://john-joseph-horton.com/papers/remote_work.pdf) of remote work by MIT researchers through Google Consumer Surveys and compared the percentage of people who switched to remote working for gender, age, region, and state. I found that gender and age interactively affect the conversion rate and region has a significant effect on the rate as well. 

## Data
The data is generated by the research [paper](https://john-joseph-horton.com/papers/remote_work.pdf) and available in this github [folder](https://github.com/johnjosephhorton/remote_work/tree/master/etl).
